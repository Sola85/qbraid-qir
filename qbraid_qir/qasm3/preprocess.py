# Use this for qasm3 equivalent too.
# custom gate definitions should be decomposed into the basic gates
# supported by the QIR conversion.
# The supported gates are defined in the opsets module.


# can use this -

# run simulations with both qasm3 and qir programs and compare the results for final tests


# can use rigetti simulator for qir programs and qiskit for qasm3 programs
